# Diabetes_Classification
This a Classification project that detect the patient have Diabetes or not 
After preprocessing and analysis we used pipeline used the transform and Standard Scaler then see what model will do better
then we use Hyperpearameter Tuning to increse the  accuracy 

the best model that perfomce well was SVC that recall was 99.2% 
with parameter was {'C': 1, 'gamma': 0.7, 'kernel': 'rbf'}
